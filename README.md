# Nukkit server with Scriptcraft

This is a Nukkit server for Minecraft Pocket Edition, with Walter Higgins' Scriptcraft plugin installed via the Pokkit plugin.

It runs, and you can do some basic things with it, but I haven't tested how well Pokkit supports the APIs that Scriptcraft uses.

## To Run

Do this in a terminal:

```bash
java -jar nukkit.jar
```

## To build in Docker

```bash
docker build . -t nukkit
```
